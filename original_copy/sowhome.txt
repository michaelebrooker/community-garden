[Protest at Woolwich Town Hall]Protesting at Woolwich Town Hall against the
Meyer_Homes 27-storey Tower proposal in front of Tesco's store.
Welcome to our website which is here to inform, and to help us campaign for a
better Woolwich, one that our communities would like to see, rather than one
imposed by developers and the council.
***** Tesco Tower - take two *****
[The old and new Tower proposals]Left, 27 storeys, and right: the new 15-storey
tower proposed
29/05/2021 - Meyer Homes, owner of the site in front of - and behind - the
Woolwich Tesco, is to submit a revised plan for Phases 3 & 4 of this long-
standing scheme, originally given outline approval by the Royal Borough of
Greenwich in 2007. The current plan reduces the tower height, to be built on
the green space in front of Tesco's store, to 15 storeys, rather than the 27 in
the previous submission, which was subject to a National Planning Appeal and
was subsequently not allowed by the Secretary of State. The number of
affordable homes in the latest scheme has yet to be announced.
Visuals of the revised scheme are online: meyerhomeswoolwich.co.uk.
***** Spray Street goes ahead *****
25/05/2021 - The Royal Borough or Greenwich^a????s (RBG) Planning Board has
approved the Spray Street scheme, now called Woolwich_Exchange, despite very
few affordable homes being included. This was the second application. The first
failed, because Woolwich Public Market - which was to be demolished in the
original plan - was listed Grade II. Now, the Public Market will be redeveloped
into a multiplex cinema.
***** Council rejects MacBean *****
05/05/2021 - The Royal Borough or Greenwich^a????s (RBG) Planning Board has thrown
out the MacBean application in a resubmission by the developer ^a???? Legal &
General - because of a lack of affordable housing. The land, which is between
Powis Street and Beresford Street, (below) has lain derelict for some
years.  More on this at the 853Blog_news_site.
