Protesting at Woolwich Town Hall against the Meyer Homes 27-storey Tower.  

{{<statement text="Welcome to our website which is here to inform, and to help us campaign for a better Woolwich, one that our communities would like to see, rather than one imposed by developers and the Council.">}}

## Return of the Tower 
Meyer Homes's plan for a 27-storey over-shadowing **General Gordon Square** was thrown out by the Housing and Communities minister in 2020, but the developer has returned, this time with a 15-storey tower to blight General Gordon Square - Woolwich's primary public space, by overshadowing it. It's lazy architecturally and could easily become another contender for the **Carbuncle Cup,** which was awarded by ***Building Design*** magazine in 2014 for the [Tesco Store and housing blocks behind](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/03/tesco-woolwich-carbuncle-cup-architectural-prize). 

This development offers very little for the community, and any **London Affordable** rented properties will be segregated from those for private rent or sale, built on the sunnyside of the site.  

**Speak Out Woolwich** objects to the imposition of this tower, the primary aim of which seems aimed at maximising profits for Meyer Homes' shareholders. **[Read more here...](/campaigns/meyer/)**
