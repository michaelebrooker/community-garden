description: It is quite difficult to photograph insects, but here is one spotted on the 29th April - an orange-tipped butterlfy - Anthocharis cardamines. About the same time as this was seen, the waterlogged areas, water spiders were seen, and after the pond areas filled at the end of July's heavy rains, many water flies Cybaeidae) were busy.
