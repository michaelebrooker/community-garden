In this new template for St John's Community Garden, I could have used the Gallery which uses bootstrap classes to put up a slideshow of images from a directory, but I just want the pictures to list into the page one after the other. 

So we can range images by: 

{{ range resources.Match "images/gallery/*" }}
  <img src="{{ .RelPermalink }}" width="{{ .Width }}" height="{{ .Height }}" alt="">
{{ end }}

Here we manually set the directory where the images are, but actually, I want the page to be a date in the format of 22May23 and for a directory to have the same name. 

I think it must be possible to set a variable to the value of the page name and then pass that to the 
range resources $imgdir"/*"

Which in the idea above would become 

$imgdir := .Permalink 

range resources $imgdir"/*/

I think
