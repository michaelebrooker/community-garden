<p><strong>Acorn Community Garden, Walton, Chesterfield, is a project to turn a small plot which has been mostly brambles, and sometimes rather soggy, into a beautiful place to discover and encourage nature, and to grow fruit &amp; vegetables as well as have fun and enjoy peace as part of the local community in Walton.</strong></p>
<p>The Project has been running for more than two years.</p>
<p>The project started Spring 2023. The year proved to be very rainy and the frequent deluges have slowed progress but also filled the pond easily.</p>
<p>This spring we have been able to plant trees which were provided by a grant, and they include fruit and nut species, as well as willows for the bank alongside the bog garden and pond.</p>
<p>In the last year we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Installed land drains and the pond and bog garden, and bank, and the paths, as well as the firepit were defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planters were constructed on site by volunteers and installed by one of our local farmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Composting bins constructed and installed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gate was installed to the car park to make access easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much hard work was done digging out and clearing brambles by community volunteers, and hedges were trimmed and overgrowth of weeds cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planned grass meadow was rotavated by lack of a dry period did not allow seeding with the grass meadow seed we had purchased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring Daffodil bulbs were planted alongside Walton Back Lane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are grateful to everyone who has come and helped and particulary to the two local farmers who have provided their equipment - diggers and rotavators - as well as expertise, and without which we could not have made such good progress.</p>
