      	<h2 id="the-two-towers">The two towers</h2>
<p>This is the second application for <strong>Meyer Homes</strong> on this site, the previous scheme - which included a <strong>27-storey tower</strong> in front of the existing Tesco store - was rejected by the Council&rsquo;s Planning Board, and the developer took it to a national appeal. But the inquiry recommended rejection of the scheme and the Minister agreed with the Planning Inspector&rsquo;s report.  The report did recommended that there <em>should</em> be building to close off <strong>General Gordon Square</strong>, but it must be lower than 27 storeys. This revised application presents a scheme where the ‘unacceptably dominating and overbearing’ 27-storey tower in Phase 3 has been reduced to a 15-storey block - shown below - which still intrudes massively into the green space outside Tesco’s.</p>
<p>This block will still loom over the neighbouring buildings around Gordon Square. Its size and shape will still be out of proportion to those other buildings. Note that the illustration projects sun light for early on a summer morning. Imagine the sun behind and above the tower, and there would be a long shadow cast over General Gordon Square for the greater part of the day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speak Out Woolwich&rsquo;s</strong></em> view is that a building on this site is unnecessary, and that the green triangle in front of Tesco&rsquo;s would be better used by being kept open and be landscaped for public use for such facilities as a public children&rsquo;s play area, of which there is none Woolwich Town.</p>

<p><img src="../../campaigns/meyer_tower_2019.jpg" alt="alt Meyer Homes original 27-storey tower submitted in 2019"></p>
<p>The site adjoins the <strong>Woolwich Conservation Area</strong> (WCA)and any development should therefore preserve or enhance the character of the WCA. This proposal does neither. It will in fact conflict completely with the principles agreed by RBG in the Woolwich Conservation Area, as highlighted in the Draft Appraisal in September 2021</p>
<p>The seven blocks proposed for Phase 4 are also disproportionately high, ranging as they do from nine to sixteen storeys. There is a clear inference that these blocks are not the most suitable architecturally that could be designed for the area but rather the biggest lumps that could be crammed into the site.</p>
<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
<p>The designs of the blocks, whether at the front or the rear of Tesco’s, are uninspiring and will detract from, rather than add to, the feeling that Woolwich has a history to celebrate, especially in the Town Centre. Some of the buildings next to the site date back to Georgian times, and many others to Victorian times, yet there is no acknowledgement of this in the design of this scheme.</p>
<h4 id="over-shadowing">Over-shadowing</h4>
<p>There will clearly be overshadowing of General Gordon Square – as the proposed tower is to the south of the square. The overshadowing is acknowledged in the Sunlight and Daylight Report, although the CGIs are far from clear as to the exact impact. The overshadowing will be at its worst in the spring, winter and autumn months and will seriously detract from the amenity of this much-loved and well-used public space.</p>
<p>Also, where the sunlight and daylight figures are shown for individual properties around the site, the report constantly harks back to the 2007 scheme. What is important for local residents is not whether conditions will be better than 2007 but the effect this plan will have on them now.</p>
<p>The tower, while no longer the copper/red colour of the original tower, now seems to have been designed to be as bland as possible, presumably in the hope that few people will spot it is there.</p>
<p>The Planning Inspector was interested in something being built to hide the carbuncle that is the current Tesco building. However, we’re not convinced the proposed revised tower is what local people would want to perform that function.</p>
<p>As was noted in the Draft Appraisal of the Woolwich Conservation Area, there are 59 Local Heritage Assets and 18 Listed Buildings in the vicinity of this site. In our response to that Draft Appraisal, we reinforced the need to make every effort to ensure the character of the area is not swamped by a slurry of monolithic tall buildings. Yet here we are with another set of monolithic tall buildings being.</p>
